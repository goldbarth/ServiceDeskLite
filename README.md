## Purpose

ServiceDeskLite is a deliberately structured engineering case built to explore and apply Clean Architecture principles in a modern .NET environment.

The project prioritizes architectural clarity over feature growth.  
Design decisions, trade-offs and system boundaries are made explicit and documented.

It reflects a commitment to treating architecture as a deliberate discipline rather than an emergent byproduct of feature growth.
